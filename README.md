This is a website for the course ``CS492 Probabilistic Programming'', which is offered 
at the KAIST CS department in the fall of 2017. The website will contain lecture slides
and other course-related materials.

## Evaluation

Midterm and final exams. Project. Homework.

## Teaching Staffs

* TA: Byungsu Kim (email: bskim90@kaist.ac.kr)

## Place and Time

* Place: Room 2443 in the E3 Building
* Time: 9:00 - 10:15 on Monday and Wednesday from August 28 2017 until December 15 2017.

There will be no lectures on the following dates:
1. September 4 (Mon) and September 6 (Wed) - Business Trip
2. October 4 (Wed) - Chuseok
3. October 9 (Mon) - Hangul Proclamation Day
4. October 16 (Mon) and October 18 (Wed) - Midterm Exam Period
5. November 13 (Mon) and November 15 (Wed) - Business Trip
6. December 11 (Mon) and December 13 (Wed) - Final Exam Period

Instead of the four missing lectures, I plan to schedule two four-hour
interview sessions with project groups. Here is our current plan:
1. 7:00pm - 9:00pm on September 21 and 22 (Thu and Fri).
2. 7:00pm - 9:00pm on October 26 and 27 (Thu and Fri).
