# CS492 Probabilistic Programming, Fall 2017, KAIST 

This is a website for the course "CS492 Probabilistic Programming", which is offered 
at the KAIST CS department in the fall of 2017. The website will contain lecture slides
and other course-related materials.

Probabilistic programming refers to the idea of developing a programming 
language for writing and reasoning about probabilistic models from machine learning 
and statistics. Such a language comes with the implementation of several generic
inference algorithms which can answer various queries about the models written 
in the language, such as posterior inference and marginalisation. By providing these
algorithms, a probabilistic programming language
enables data scientists to focus on using their domain expertise and
building good models, not designing 
effective algorithms of their models, which often requires deep knowledge
in machine learning, statistics and systems. Even experts in machine learning
and statistics can get benefitted from such a probabilistic programming system
because using the system they can easily explore highly advanced models.

This course has two goals. The first is to help students to be a good user
of an expressive probabilistic programming language. 
Throughout the course, we will use a particular probabilistic
programming language, called [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/),
but we will emphasise general principles that apply to a wide range of existing probabilistic
programming systems. The second goal is to expose the students to recent exciting results
in probabilistic programming, which come from machine learning, statistics, 
programming languages, and probability theory. 
Through a group project, students will be given a chance to study one such result,
to present what they learn, and to ponder over the result.

## Group Activities

2-3 people form a group and have to do two main tasks. The first is to select a recent paper on probabilistic programming or a related topic, and to give a 30-min presentation on the selected paper. The second is to carry out a project on building a cool application of probabilistic programming, or on extending existing results slightly. This extension neither has to be grand nor has to produce better algorithms in terms of performance than existing ones, as long as it is analyzed and carried out thoughtfully. In an ideal world, both activities are related; a group reads a paper, presents it, and works on extending the results in the paper. This ideal is, however, just a recommendation, not a requirement.
